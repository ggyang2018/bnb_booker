bnb_booker is a software package for a B&B room booking developed for a chartable B&B (now it out business).  bnb_booker is stand-alone with rich client user interface and self-contained database. It aims at zero training, zero management, and intuitive, so that is good for somebody to use it without computing experience.  The client interface is based on Calendar GUI together with different colours to represent booking event. The project purpose would be as start point for somebody to develop more comprehensive product or simply modify the code for your purpose.  Hopefully it could help some chartable B&B manage their room booking without cost. 

Develop note: bnb_booker was written in Java,  IDE is IntelliJ IDEA, and build tool is gradle with kotlin DSL
